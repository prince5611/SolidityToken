**PROJECT OBJECTIVE**

Create a smart contract that implements a custom token with the ability to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens. 
The contract should maintain public variables for token details and a mapping of addresses to balances. 
Mint and burn functions will be implemented with proper conditionals to ensure data consistency.
